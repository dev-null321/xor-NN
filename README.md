# xor-NN
This a simple Neural Network that solves for XOR. The XOR problem 


 XOR (exclusive OR) is a logical operation that takes two binary inputs and produces an output based on the following rule:

- If the inputs are different (one input is 1 and the other is 0), the output is 1.
- If the inputs are the same (both inputs are either 0 or 1), the output is 0.

In other words, the XOR operation returns true (1) if the inputs differ, and false (0) if the inputs are the same.


| Input A | Input B | Output |
|---------|---------|--------|
|    0    |    0    |   0    |
|    0    |    1    |   1    |
|    1    |    0    |   1    |
|    1    |    1    |   0    |
